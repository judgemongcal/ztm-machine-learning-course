    "# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data scinece libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has a heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",

    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",

    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not a patient has heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "* Originally from UCI - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease\n",
    "* Dataset used for this project is from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursure this project.\n",
